                                <p>playonlinux was removed due to too many complaints that not a lot was working with it. You can reinstall with sudo apt install playonlinux && sudo apt remove wine You need to remove wine because playonlinux will install the arm version which will conflict with x86 version of wine.</p>

                                    <p>Right before the global pandemic happened I worked full time in a warehouse. Since being laid off I've been trying to learn and develop a new skill that I am not 100% familiar with. About
                                        The majority of this site design was quickly done over a weekend of learning so yes, a lot is broken and a lot will get fixed as I learn more and further develop a new skill set that I 
                                        previously lacked three months ago. As I learn more, the site will improve over time. So please be patient with me on my journey to develop a new skill. :)

                                    <p>This site is up on GitHub so feel free to point out anything and everything that you find wrong and if you're a developer I would love to hear from you on any potential fixes!</p>

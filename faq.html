                </h4>
                    <p>You must have disabled auto-login
                    If that's the case, you'll just need to hit "enter" when taken to the console prompt. It'll tell you "invalid login" or something to that effect
                    Then, when prompted, enter "pi" as the username, and "raspberry" as the password (or whatever you've changed the pi account password to)
                    Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop, and then you'll be able to launch RetroPie by just double-clicking on the icon</p>
